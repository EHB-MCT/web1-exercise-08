Why Noggin?

We make it easy for you to create and publish your online courses to teach anything from web development to personal finance.


No code? No problem.
Build your course from scratch, curriculum to publish, with nothing but the magical powers of Notion.

Update, anytime.
Keep improving and dynamically updating your course material based on learner feedback or new insights.

Super fast!
Okay, this is awkward, but Noggin ensures your course loads fast. Way faster than the average Notion page.

Your course, your domain.
Use custom domain (or subdomain) to publish and host your course. Like youarewelcome.com

Bring your tools to the party.
Integrate your favourite third-party tools to get site analytics, provide chat support or offer 1:1 calls.

Get paid for your work.
Collect payments for your course (if you’d like!) with Gumroad, Stripe, Buy Me a Coffee or alike.
